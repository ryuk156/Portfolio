Hangman is a classic word-guessing game in which one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters, with each incorrect guess resulting in the drawing of a stick figure being hanged. In this version of the game, which has been made with React Native and TypeScript, players can enjoy the game on their mobile devices. The game utilizes the React Native framework for building mobile apps, and TypeScript for providing static typing and other language features to make the code more robust and maintainable.
