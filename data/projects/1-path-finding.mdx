A* Path Finding Visualizer System is a visualisation of finding the shortest path.The shortest path is then traced by using A* algorithm of finding paths in python

Through this system user can just create different barriers and obstacles which the system automatically scans and find the most best and most efficient way to reach it destination point

Users have a heuristic function that helps guide and figure out the correct path go by essentially as the individual get familiar to the algorithm system will only consider paths that are optimal and will not consider things that have a huge distance to get to the end point.

It may consider them but at least priority.
